Echo Mobile (Expo + React Native + TypeScript)

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies
   cd mobile
   npm install

2. Start Expo
   npm run start

Notes:
- This is a minimal Expo scaffold that connects to the socket server at http://localhost:3000 by default.
- Running on a physical device may require updating the SOCKET_URL to the host machine IP.
